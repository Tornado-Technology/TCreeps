My main AI for amzing MMO-Sanbox game for programmers: [Screeps](https://screeps.com/)

This is not some muga cool AI capable of defeating everyone. No. This is my own AI that I sometimes write for my game and decided to open its code. If you want to help or comment, you can do it!

## Initilaze 
For more convenient programming on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
 1) You should download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 2) Open folder and write command `npm install`
